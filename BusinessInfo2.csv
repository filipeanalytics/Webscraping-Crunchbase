(""4M""​), a Knoxville, Tennessee-based carbon-fiber technology company holds the exclusive rights to commercialize atmospheric plasma oxidation for the production of carbon fiber that was co-developed with Oak Ridge National Laboratory and RMX Technologies. 4M completed a reverse merger in 2017 with Woodland HoldingsCorp., an SEC reporting company (""Woodland""​ or the ""Company""​) to position itself as a public entity. 4M became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Woodland, through which Woodland will conduct its business operations. The company expects to be trading in late 2018. 4M recently determined that the best way to extract the economic and technical value from the technology is to build production lines using the technology and sell fiber. The technology has been proven to use 75% less energy, produce a high-quality fiber, and use 1/3 footprint for the same production capacity. These claims have been validated by multiple international carbon fiber producers. The company is in discussions with several of the world’s largest carbon fiber makers and a billion dollar per year international energy savings performance company to build five production lines in the next 5 years using the technology. The use of this technology is expected to reduce the cost of carbon fiber by 20%.
